## Manipulate Microsoft Data Environment Add,Edit,Delete,Seach


</div>

### Description

As a lot of other people's reasons for posting source I post this because I couldn't find any help with the MS Data Environment. So after playing around with it I finally got it to do what I wanted it to. This Example is composed of basic ways to manipulate the Data environment. Add, Edit, Delete, Search, and pull report information. Use of ADO Transactions is also covered. Hope you enjoy it and learn something. The example uses the basic contact database concept. Please vote if this code is useful.
